# Real time (WebSocket) API

Broid's RealTime API is used for maintaining persistent, stateful websocket connections between your client and our servers. These connections are used for receiving real-time events your client can use to track and update local state. The Gateway API uses secure websocket connections as specified in [RFC#6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) RFC 6455\. For information on opening Gateway connections, please see the [RealTime API](#realtime_overview) documentation.
